## Setup Instructions

To get the project up and running, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the project to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

### 2. Serve Product Images

Navigate to the `products` folder in the terminal:

```bash
cd products
```

Then, run the following command to serve images via `http-server`:

```bash
npx http-server
```

This will start a local server to serve the images from the `products` folder.

### 3. Open the Project in Your Browser

Now, open the `homepage.html` file in your browser. Simply double-click on the file or open it via a browser to view the website.

### 4. Optional: Database Connectivity

If you want to enable database connectivity for uploading images to MongoDB, you can run:

```bash
python uploadImages.py
```

This script will upload images to MongoDB, though images are currently served directly from the local folder.

## Future Enhancements

### Backend AI/ML Model Integration for Live Predictions
   - Currently, the project uses dummy JSON files to simulate personalized product recommendations based on user preferences. In the future, we plan to integrate a backend AI/ML model to provide live, real-time predictions and recommendations. This model will analyze user behavior and preferences to offer dynamic and personalized product suggestions, enhancing the user experience.
